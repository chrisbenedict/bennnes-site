- Four main pages: Home (index.html), Cooking, Random, and About
- Clean, minimal design philosophy
- Responsive layout that works on all devices

## Design Principles
- Minimalistic and clean design
- Typography-focused with plenty of white space
- Subtle borders and gentle color palette
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessibility-conscious markup

## Code Style
- Semantic HTML5 elements
- CSS organized by sections (reset, navigation, content, footer, responsive)
- Consistent naming conventions
- Clean, readable code structure

## Content Guidelines
